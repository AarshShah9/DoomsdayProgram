# The Doomsday Program
## Description
This a terminal based python algorithm that uses a a concept founded by John Conway that essentially states since the Gergorian Calender cycles every 400 years the day of the week for any date can be calculated with a simple mental calculation. I took this mental calculation and turned it into a algorithm in python that relies on basic artithemtic to calculate the day of the week

### Version 1.1
This version consists of basic artithmetic and user created dictionaries, relying on no libray's. A series of checks are done to ensure the inputted date is a valid and then the algorthim is called to calculate the date.
